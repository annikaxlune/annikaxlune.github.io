## 10 Days till HS

Final countdown till highschool begins! Getting pretty excited and nervous.

* I woke up at 2am and was up till 4am because of really bad period cramps. Thankfully they went away at 10 am.

* Today, my parents and I (and my lil brother) we moved around the furniture in my room & bought a new table (really good standing tresanti table, really expensive).
My room looks so pretty and it has "opened up"; more space. I really appreciate and love my parents - so greatful for them. This whole room change has me really motivated.

* My new glasses also came on Thursday and I absolutely love them; took a few days to get used to them, but I really do like them. 

* After my room was mostly set up, I went to the library for a science bowl practice for 2 hours. After, I got a library card, I've been reading alot. 

School and the FISH Camp Orientation is coming up soon - pretty excited. 

* Tomorrow is a bit busy: in the morning I have a quick badminton practice with a couple of my friends for an hour, then I'm going to my friends house, and once I come
back I have a class, and around that time my parents are going out together! And that ends the 2nd to last weekend before highschool starts. Crazy.
