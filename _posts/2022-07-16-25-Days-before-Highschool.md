## 25 Days before Highschool
First Post ðŸ˜Š

It's surprising how quickly summer has gone by. Highschool is right around the corner and I doubt I'm ready for it. From 7/18/22 till 8/05/22, I am taking the F=ma Advanced AB course from Alphastar. I am really excited especially since I don't really have much exposure to physics. 

#### Book Rec
- [x] A Walk to Remember 

I finished reading this today morning. A short bittersweet romance. In some ways reminded me of the book The Fault in our Stars.

#### Other
I have started listening to a lot of random kpop songs that are soothing to the ear. Recently, I have taken interest in Chemistry; I find it really exciting. For some reason, I find it really difficult to just start doing math. Whenever I am really bad at something I always avoid it, and I only do the things that seem to be easier. Days have been just been passing by.

We have the MSA Fish Camp on 8/05/22 from 8am - 1pm., sounds pretty fun, we can meet the other freshman and tour the school probably and clubs. Practically all of my friends (not that many in the first place) are going to completly different highschools. 

#### Courses
So, we haven't gotten our official schedule, but the courses that we chose are final:
- [ ] AAC English 1

I'm not too worried about this course, but english has never been my strong point. I never heard anything from other students about this course/teachers.

- [ ] AAC Algebra 2

Not worried at all. I heard that 1 of my friends took the CBE for this; I wish I did too. 

- [ ] AP Human Geography

Now this course...everyone talks about it. The teacher is apparently really strict and takes of points on the smallest things, I am very worried for this class. It is also said to be really time consuming. Quite a handful of my friends took this course during this summer.

- [ ] AP Comp. Sci. Principles

This course is a mix of java and python. I never heard anything about it in particular...I think I will be fine as I know both those languages.

- [ ] AAC Chemistry

I heard the teacher teaches well, not much to worry about. I'm pretty excited.

- [ ] AP Physics 1

The teacher doesn't teach at all, but the grading is easy. I don't know any physics which is why I'm taking the AlphaStar Course in 2 days. Hopefully, I learn and understand at least something.

- [ ] Multidisciplinary Studies 1

This is the Decathlon Course. Honestly, I was thinking of dropping this course mid way through summer (not possible). My dad was really happy hearing I'm taking it. I really badly wanted to learn Sign Language and take that course instead of this. It's okay, I will take it next year, hopefully I will have space in my schedule. I am like 99% sure that I won't continue this, but it is a good experience, I might as well make the most of it this year.

#### Things to complete before school starts
- [ ] Biology â†’ (Campbell) Finish Unit 3 & 4: Total 13 Chapters
- [ ] Chemistry â†’ JPH Chem, Keep up with classes & hw as well as Atkins, Practice Problems (Barron's): Chapter 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 
- [ ] Physics â†’ AlphaStar Camp, Giancoli corresponding chapters & practice problems
- [ ] AMC 10 â†’ Advanced Booster Course (Spend 1 hour a day)
- [ ] Precalculus â†’ 20 days, 1 per day + problems from textbook
- [ ] Intermediate C&P â†’ 18 days, 1 per day + problems from textbook
- [ ] USACO Bronze â†’ Bronze Section in USACO Guide, 2011-2012 problems
- [ ] PSAT/SAT â†’ Grind through books / practice
- [ ] Badminton â†’ probably only going for another week, and after that i'll continue once school starts
- [ ] Violin â†’ 30 min daily (i really got to start practicing), shifting & book 3 
- [ ] Decathlon â†’ very behind with this...just finish the readings for that are nescessary
- [ ] Health â†’ Summer Course, already completed, just have to take the final exam...
- [ ] Summer Research Project â†’ working on a project, get most of it done? depends when i can meet w my mentor 
- [ ] NHD â†’ I already have come up with a possible topic, I'll most likely move forward with it, get my research and outline of exhibit done
- [ ] Personal â†’ Probably cut down the amount of sugar intake ðŸ˜… & go for runs almost evey day, i really do enjoy running, read 1-2 new books

This is actually a lot to do sounds more like a complete summer plan ðŸ˜° I guess I really have alot to do, better stop wasting my time.
